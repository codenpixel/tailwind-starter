# starter
My tailwind starter theme.
this is the first beta based on my other wp starter

steps:
1) download a release
2) run npm install
3) run npm start for the dev environment
4) when you're done run npm run build
5) you'll find the pure theme within the bundled folder or you could just delete the node_modules and the bundled folders if you'd rather keep your src files intact
